I designed this [Shiny app](https://lokraj.shinyapps.io/gcplotR/) to generate growth curves. This app is based on ggplot and dplyr functions.You can try by downloading [sample data here](https://github.com/lrjoshi/files/blob/master/public/c159s.csv).Codes are available on my [Github](https://github.com/lrjoshi/gcplotR).Sometimes, the app goes to idle state.You can activate it by clicking **Reload** button below. Here is the sample output.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://lokraj.shinyapps.io/gcplotR/",
                   height = "600px")

```
