**Abstract**

Senecavirus A (SVA) is an emerging picornavirus that
has been associated with outbreaks of vesicular disease
in swine. In 2015, neonatal mortality affecting piglets
of 07 days of age correlated with SVA, was reported
in Brazil. Here, we present an investigation carried
on during 20152016 in five farrowtofinish swine operations
in Southern Brazil showing an increased
neonatal mortality and also vesicular disease that
have been associated to SVA infection. Piglets were
lethargic and had a watery diarrhea. The mortality
rate increased in 23% and in some littermates a 100%
of mortality was observed. Despite of a relatively fast
onset of wasting syndrome progressing to mortality, all
herds recovered to baseline mortality levels within 410
days. Piglets were necropsied and tissue samples were
collected for histopathology, RTPCR for SVA detection
targeting the VP1 VP3 region, and for viral isolation in
H1299 cell culture. Genome sequences of VP1 gene of
five SVA isolates were compared to other SVA sequences
available on GenBank. Necropsy of six piglets revealed
empty stomach and mesocolonic edema. In general,
it was observed enlargement and edema of inguinal
lymph nodes, pulmonary edema, ascites and ulcerative
lesions on the snout and coronary band. Microscopic
lesions were characterized by necrotic epidermitis and
dermatitis of coronary band, mild enteritis with villus
degeneration on small intestine, marked mesocolon
edema and multifocal hemorrhage with lung edema.
Senecavirus A was detected by RTPCR in tonsil, lung,
liver, intestine and coronary band. SVA was isolated in
cell culture from tonsil, lung, intestine and coronary band
from piglets of all farms. Sequence comparisons based
on a region of the VP1 gene (541 base pairs) revealed
that the Brazilian isolates characterized here share 96-
99% of nucleotide (nt) identity with contemporary
Brazilian isolates, 9598% nt identity with US and 9093%
nt identity with the prototype strain SVV001. SVA
was associated with neonatal mortality based on RTPCR,
virus isolation and sequencing results. The genetic
analysis shows the diversity of the Brazilian SVA isolates
and that more studies are needed to demonstrate if there
are differences between SVA from neonatal mortality
and vesicular cases. SVA is clinically and economically
important due to its resemblance with vesicular diseases,
so the diagnosis tools are critical to confirm the initial
investigation.
