I have worked on developing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against emerging viruses. I have 
developed monoclonal antibodies for Severe acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which is an emerging coronavirus of swine. Recently, I have been involved in developing monoclonal antibodies for SARS-COV-2. We use
those antibodies mainly for diagnostic assay development. I have experience developing and optimizing ELISA and immunoflorescence assays for novel viruses.
