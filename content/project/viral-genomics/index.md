We are using Illumina MiSeq for viral genome sequencing.We have sequenced over 40 isolated of Senecavirus A using Illumina Miseq. Often we run viral metagenomic sequencing in [clinical samples for disease diagnosis](https://lokfiles.netlify.com/papilloma.pdf). I have deep interest in viral informatics. In the **Posts** section of this webpage you can find some of the tools I am learning to develop my bioinformatics skills.
