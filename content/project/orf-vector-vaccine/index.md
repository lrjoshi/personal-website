I have been involved in the projects that aims to develop orf virus as a vaccine delivery platform in poxvirus.
We have already shown that orf virus expressing spike protein of porcine epidemic diarrhe virus (PEDV) provides protection 
against lethal challenge in pigs. I am currently working to develop orf virus based veccine targeting swine influenza virus.
